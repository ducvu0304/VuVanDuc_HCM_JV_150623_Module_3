Java Character streams are the ones that are used to implement the input and output for 16-bit Unicode.
Several classes are associated with character streams in Java, but the most commonly used classes are FileReader and FileWriter.
Internally, the FileReader class uses FileInputStream and the FileWriter class uses FileOutputStream.
Nevertheless, the significant contrast is that FileReader and FileWriter read and write two bytes,
respectively.
